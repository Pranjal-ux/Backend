React is a popular open-source JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building fast, interactive, and reusable user interfaces—especially single-page applications. It uses a component-based architecture, meaning the UI is divided into small, independent pieces. React updates the UI efficiently using the Virtual DOM, which reduces unnecessary re-rendering and improves performance. It also supports state and props to manage and pass data in applications. React is widely used because it’s fast, scalable, easy to maintain, and backed by a large community.
