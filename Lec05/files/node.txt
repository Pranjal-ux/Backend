Node.js is an open-source, server-side JavaScript runtime built on Google’s V8 engine. It allows developers to run JavaScript outside the browser to build backend applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which makes it fast, scalable, and efficient—especially for real-time apps like chats, streaming, or APIs. It includes npm, the world’s largest package ecosystem, making development easier and faster.
